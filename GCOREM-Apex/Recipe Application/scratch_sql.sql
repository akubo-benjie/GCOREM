- Collections enable you to temporarily capture one or more nonscalar values. You can use collections to store rows and columns currently in session state so they can be accessed, manipulated, or processed during a user's specific session. You can think of a collection as a bucket in which you temporarily store and name rows of information.
- Working around for adding multiple steps.(Collections will be used for the calculation(Total Number of ingredients) for the recipe.)
